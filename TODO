Immediately solvable:
* Text-fitting for buttons
* Arrange buttons into multiple columns as needed


Eventual:
* Come up with a more robust format for input files
* Less hacky window sizing, to allow for non-pinephone devices


Possibilities:
* Allow images on buttons instead of text
* Add syntax for multi-level menus, rather than only stateless buttons
